### Fil de Fer

The “Fil de Fer” project at 42 is a basic graphics programming challenge in which we have to create a simple wireframe model viewer using MinilibX.  
The task is to read a map from a file, which contains a grid of points with elevations, and render it as a 3D landscape using basic graphics techniques.  
The project serves as an introduction to graphics programming, focusing on the transformation of 2D grids into 3D visualizations,  
and the management of user input for dynamic visualization.


## Usage:
```
